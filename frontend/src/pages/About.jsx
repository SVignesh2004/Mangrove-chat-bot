        The Mangrove Explorer project is designed to educate and raise awareness
        about the importance of mangrove forests — their flora, fauna, and
        ecological balance. Our chatbot provides interactive insights into how
        mangroves protect coastlines, support biodiversity, and benefit local
        communities.
